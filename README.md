Final project for University of Washington's Interactive Data Visualization course

## Setting Up


All you need to do is:
```
$ npm install -g idyll
```

You _**do no need to run these**_, but these commands were used to set up the project:
```
$ npm install -g yo generator-idyll
$ yo idyll
```

There are plugins for code syntax for both [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mathisonian.idyll-syntax) [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/language-idyll).

Read over the [syntax](http://idyll-lang.org/syntax) for the language.

To run the project, simply use:
```
$ idyll index.idl --watch
```
